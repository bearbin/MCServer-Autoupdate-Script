MCServer Automatic Updating Shell Script
==========================

This script works in tandem with MCServer (http://mc-server.org/) to update the binary executable to the newest version.
It requires Linux, and utilises the Jenkins build server hosted by bearbin (https://github.com/bearbin/) located at http://ci.berboe.co.uk/
